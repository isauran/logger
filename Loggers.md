## Best Practices

### Choosing a Logger
- For new projects: Consider `log/slog` as it's official and modern
- For high-performance requirements: Use `zap` or `zerolog`
- For microservices: Consider `go-kit/log`
- For maximum features: Use `logrus`

### Using Specialized Loggers
1. Integrate with main project logger
2. Configure appropriate log levels per environment
3. Set up monitoring system integration
4. Use context-based logging
5. Standardize log formatting across different loggers

### Common Features Across Loggers
- Log levels
- Structured output
- JSON formatting
- Context awareness
- Custom formatters
- Multiple output handlers
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

### Integration Tips
1. Use middleware for web framework loggers
2. Configure sampling for high-traffic systems
3. Set up proper log rotation
4. Implement error handling
5. Use context propagation
6. Configure appropriate log levels
7. Standardize timestamp formats
8. Set up proper log collection
